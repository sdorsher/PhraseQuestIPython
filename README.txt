Hello there. This repository has not been under development for several months, but I do intend to come back to it. I have been sick due to medication changes with regard to my migraines and seizures, a car accident, and have been having some transportation problems due to a move that resulted in a drivers license being downgraded to a state ID because of seizures. I am also having some trouble with stabalizing my email and cell phone connectivity. Discord, Skype, and Teamspeak are also all down. Until at least some of this situation resolves, my job search is on hold. I am still unempoloyed and do still intend to develop this project ultimately. Thank you.
